ðŸ“– **Libft**
=====

<p>This is my custom library I made while studying at 42 Mulhouse and that I will update over time as I study.<br>
Feel free to tell me your thoughts and if there's anything to improve it :)</p>

Enjoy~

-----

**Currently added:**
- LIBFT
- FT_PRINTF
- GET_NEXT_LINE
- Few extra functions

**Side Notes:**
- The goal of the library is to get to use the least amount of C standard library functions as possible!
- If you are a student of 42 and came for solutions, be aware some functions has been sightly modified for little extra handy features
