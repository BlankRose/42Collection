===  Preliminary tests  ===
[ Yes / No ]

If cheating is suspected, the evaluation stops here. Use the "Cheat" flag to report it. Take this decision calmly, wisely, and please, use this button with caution.
Prerequisites

	The code must compile with c++ and the flags -Wall -Wextra -Werror
	Don't forget this project has to follow the C++98 standard. Thus,
	C++11 (and later) functions or containers are NOT expected.

Any of these means you must not grade the exercise in question:

    A function is implemented in a header file (except for template functions).
    A Makefile compiles without the required flags and/or another compiler than c++.

Any of these means that you must flag the project with "Forbidden
Function":

    Use of a "C" function (*alloc, *printf, free).
    Use of a function not allowed in the exercise guidelines.
    Use of "using namespace <ns_name>" or the "friend" keyword.
    Use of an external library, or features from versions other than C++98.



===  Exercise 00: Aaaaand... OPEN!  ===

As usual, there has to be enough tests to prove the program works as required. If there isn't, do not grade this exercise.

1 . Class and attributes
[ Yes / No ]

	There is a ClapTrap class.
	It has all the following private attributes:

	    name
	    hit points
	    energy points
	    attack damage The attributes are initialized to the required values.

2 . Member functions
[ Yes / No ]

	The class has following member functions and they work as specified:

	    attack()
	    takeDamage()
	    beRepaired()



===  Exercise 01: Serena, my love!  ===

As usual, there has to be enough tests to prove the program works as required. If there isn't, do not grade this exercise.

1 . Class and attributes
[ Yes / No ]

	There is a ScavTrap class.
	The ScavTrap publicly inherits from the ClapTrap class.
	It does not re-declare any attributes.
	The ClapTrap attributes are now protected instead of private.
	The attributes are initialized to the required values.

2 . Member functions
[ Yes / No ]

	The class has following member functions and they work as specified:

	    attack()
	    takeDamage() (inherited)
	    beRepaired() (inherited) The outputs of the constructor, destructor, and the attack() function must be different from the ClapTrap's.

3 . Construction and destruction
[ Yes / No ]

	There must be a constructor and a destructor for the ScavTrap displaying
	specific messages. They must be implemented so that they are called in the
	correct order when used. This means if you create a ScavTrap, it must first
	display the ClapTrap's message then the ScavTrap's. If you delete a ScavTrap,
	it must display the ScavTrap's message first, then the ClapTrap's.

4 . Special feature
[ Yes / No ]

	ScavTrap has a guardGate() function that displays a message on the
	standard output. It has also an attack() function that displays a short
	message on the standard output, which must be different from the original
	ClapTrap message.



===  Exercise 02: Repetitive work  ===

As usual, there has to be enough tests to prove the program works as required. If there isn't, do not grade this exercise.

1 . Class and attributes
[ Yes / No ]

	There is a FragTrap class that publicly inherits from ClapTrap.
	Attributes must not be re-declared without reasons.

2 . Construction and destruction
[ Yes / No ]

	There must be a constructor and a destructor for the FragTrap displaying
	specific messages. They must be implemented so that they are called in the
	correct order when used. This means if you create a FragTrap, it must first
	display the ClapTrap's message then the FragTrap's. If you delete a FragTrap,
	it must display the FragTrap's message first, then the ClapTrap's.

3 . Special feature
[ Yes / No ]

	There is a highFivesGuys() function that displays a message on the
	standard output.

===  Exercise 03: Now it is weird!  ===

As usual, there has to be enough tests to prove the program works as required. If there isn't, do not grade this exercise.

1 . Ultimate C++ weird feature
[ Yes / No ]

	There is a DiamondTrap class.
	It inherits from both the FragTrap and the ScavTrap.
	The attributes are set to the appropriate values.
	It uses virtual inheritance to avoid the pitfalls of diamond inheritance.

2 . Choose wisely...
[ Yes / No ]

	The DiamondTrap uses the attack() method of the Scavtrap.
	It has the special functions of both its parents.
	The DiamondTrap has a private std::string name member.
	The function whoAmI() can display both name and clapTrap::name.
