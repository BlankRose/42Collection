/!\ Incomplete correction (Exercice 01)
/!\ This is a new module and might change alot the upcomming weeks



===  Preliminary tests  ===
[ Yes / No ]

If cheating is suspected, the evaluation stops here. Use the "Cheat" flag to report it. Take this decision calmly, wisely, and please, use this button with caution.

	The code must compile with c++ and the flags -Wall -Wextra -Werror
	Don't forget this project has to follow the C++98 standard. Thus,
	C++11 (and later) functions or containers are NOT expected.

	Any of these means you must not grade the exercise in question:

	    A function is implemented in a header file (except for template functions).
	    A Makefile compiles without the required flags and/or another compiler than c++.

	Any of these means that you must flag the project with "Forbidden
	Function":

	    Use of a "C" function (*alloc, *printf, free).
	    Use of a function not allowed in the exercise guidelines.
	    Use of "using namespace <ns_name>" or the "friend" keyword.
	    Use of an external library, or features from versions other than C++98.



===  Exercise 00: Bitcoin Exchange ===

For this frst exercise, you have to find a makefile with the usual compilation rules and subject

1 . Code review
[ Yes / No ]

	Check that a makefile is present with the usual compilation rules.
	Check in the code that the program Uses at least one container.
	The person being evaluated must explain why they chose to use this
	container and not another?
	If not, the evaluation stops here.

2 . Error handle
[ Yes / No ]

	You must be able to use an empty file or a file with errors
	(a basic example exists in the subject). Ihe program must not stop
	its execution before having pertormed the operations on the whole
	file passed as argument.
	You can Use a wrong date.
	You can enter a value greater than 1000 or less than 0.
	IF there is any problem during the execution then the evaluation stops here.

3 . Main usage
[ Yes / No ]

	You must now use the input.csv tile located at the top ot this page.
	You can modity this ftile with the values you want.
	You have to run the program with the input.csv tile as parameter
	Please compare some dates manually with the specitied value.
	It the date does not exist in the database, the program will have to use the
	nearest lower date.



===  Exercise 01: Reverse Polish Notation  ===

For this second exercise, you have to find a makefile with the usual compilation rules an subject

1 . Code review
[ Yes / No ]

	Check that a makefile is present with the usual compilation rules.
	Check in the code that the program Uses at least one container.
	The person being evaluated must explain why they chose to use this
	container and not another?
	If not, the evaluation stops here.

2 . Main usage
[ Yes / No ]



===  Exercise 02: PmergeMe  ===

As Usual, there has to be enough tests to prove the program works as expected. IF there isnt,
exercise. If any non-intertace class is not in orthodox canonical class form, do not grade this

1 . Code review
[ Yes / No ]

	Check that a makefile is included with the usual compilation rules rules.
	Check in the code that the program uses at least two containers.
	If not, the evaluation stops here.
	The person being evaluated must explain why they chose fo use these containers
	and not another?
	Check in the code that the merge-insert sort algorithm is present and
	is used for each container.
	If one of the containers chosen here is included in one ot the previous
	exercises then the evaluation stops here.

2 . Main usage
[ Yes / No ]

	You can now manually check that the program works correctly by using between
	5 and 10 ditferent positive integers of your choice as program arguments.
	It this first test works and gives a sorted sequence of numbers you can continue.
	If not, the evaluation stops now.
	Now you have to check this operation by using the following command as an
	argument to the program:
	
	For linux:
		shuf -i 1-1000 -n 3000 tr "\n""
	For OSX:
		jot -r 3000 1 1000 | tr '\n'

	It the command works correctly, the person being evaluated should be able to
	explain the difference in time used for each container selected.
	If there are any problems during the execution and/or explanation then the
	evaluation stops here.
