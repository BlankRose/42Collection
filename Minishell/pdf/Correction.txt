    ctrl-C in a prompt after you wrote some stuff should display a new line with a new prompt.
    The buffer should be clean too. Press "Enter" to make sure nothing from the previous line is executed.
    ctrl-D in a prompt after you wrote some stuff should not do anything.
    ctrl-\ in a prompt after you wrote some stuff should not do anything.
    Try ctrl-C after running a blocking command like cat without arguments or grep “something“.
    Try ctrl-\ after running a blocking command like cat without arguments or grep “something“.

===  Bonus  ===

Evaluate the bonus part if, and only if, the mandatory part has been entirely and perfectly done, and the error management handles unexpected or bad usage. In case all the mandatory points were not passed during the defense, bonus points must be totally ignored.

1 . And, Or
[ Yes / No ]

    Use &&, || and parenthesis with commands and ensure minishell behaves the same way bash does.

    Use wildcards in arguments in the current working directory.
