===  Preliminaries  ===

Nothing out of the ordinary.

1 . The basics
[ Yes / No ]

    If at least one of the following points fails, the defense stops.

        git clone at the beginning of the defence.
        There is something in the git repository.
        The Makefile is ok

2 . Libraries
[ Yes / No ]

    In this section we'll check that only the libraries authorized
    in the subject are used. For the management of windows and
    events. No library allowed for the matrix, the shaders or the obj files management.



===  Do the job  ===

1 . Display
[ Yes / No ]

    In this section check that a window opens properly and that
    a 3D object is displayed. The hidden sides must be properly
    managed.

2 . Perspective
[ Yes / No ]

    The object is in perspective: what's in the back is smaller than
    what's in the front.

3 . Colors
[ Yes / No ]

    Check that there is indeed one color per side. Try out with
    an object that has sides that are not triangles. This question
    is considered OK as well if an algorithm to triangulate sides
    which aren't is implemented. In this case it's normal to have
    triangles of different colors.

4 . It turns
[ Yes / No ]

    The object turns, around what should be gravity center on the
    vertical axis. It's not turning around an edge.

5 . Movements
[ Yes / No ]

    It's possible to move the object on the 3 axis using 6 keys.
    When moved, the object still turns around its own axis.

6 . Textures
[ Yes / No ]

    Pressing a specific key allows the smooth appearance of a
    texture on the object. The texture don't need to be applied
    perfectly on every faces but there needs to be some were it's
    accurate (see example in the subject).

7 . 42
[ Yes / No ]

    The 42 object is loaded, it turns on the right axis, it's
    movable, sides are of different shades of gray, there is
    kittens/ponies/unicorns as a texture.

8 . Something else
[ Yes / No ]

    Some other simple obj files are parsed and properly displayed.
    At least teapot2.obj but some others is also good.



===  Bonus  ===

1 . obj files
[ Score 0 to 5 ]

    Non trivial obj file rendering: non coplanar, concave sides,
    triangularisation. Check with teapot.obj and at least another
    ambiguous obj file.

2 . Texture ++
[ Yes / No ]

    The texture isn't distorsed on any of the sides.

3 . Other ?
[ Score 0 to 5 ]

    A lot of bonuses :)
