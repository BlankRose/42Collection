===  Bonus  ===

We will look at your bonuses if and only if your mandatory part is excellent. This means that you must complete the
mandatory part, beginning to end, and your error management must be flawless, even in cases of twisted or bad
usage. So if you didn't score all the points on the mandatory part during this defence bonuses will be totally ignored.

1 . ft_atoi_base
[ Yes / No ]

	Check if ft_atoi_base is working as expected
	Try with a base 2 and a base 314

2 . ft_list_push
[ Yes / No ]

	Check if ft_list_push is working as expected

3 . ft_list_size
[ Yes / No ]

4 . ft_list_sort
[ Yes / No ]

	Check if ft_list_sort is working as expected

5 . ft_list_remove_if
