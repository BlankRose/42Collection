===   Preliminaries   ===
[ Yes / No ]

	First, check that the following is true:

		Something has been uploaded to the GiT repository.

		There are valid Makefiles with the usual rules where appropriate.

		If any source file is read (read(), fread(), etc...) in any of the source files,
		this is considered cheating. In this case, select the CHEAT flag.

		The use of argc/argv is strictly forbidden. If used, select the CHEAT flag.



===   Colleen   ===

1 . Colleen_start
[ Yes / No ]

	Examine the source code. Make sure it follows the following restrictions:

		Two comments as specified in the subject, including comment within a function.
		A function in addition to main().
		A call to that function from main().

2 . Compilation & checking
[ Yes / No ]

	Run make.

	Once compiled (verify the executable is named correctly), run the following command:
	./Colleen > tmp_Colleen; diff tmp_Colleen Colleen.c

	If there were any errors (diff output), the correction ends here.



===   Grace   ===

1 . Grace_start
[ Yes / No ]

	Examine the source code. Make sure it follows the following restrictions:

		A comment as specified in the subject.
		No direct functions, (main() included).
		Three defines.

2 . Compilation & checking
[ Yes / No ]

	Run make.

	Once compiled (verify the executable is named correctly), run the following command:
	rm Grace_kid.c; ./Grace ; diff Grace_kid.c Grace.c

	If there were any errors (diff output), the correction ends here.



===   Sully   ===

1 . Sully_start
[ Yes / No ]

	Examine the source code. Make sure it follows the following restrictions:

		An integer initialized to 5.

2 . Compilation & checking
[ Yes / No ]

	Run make.

	Once compiled (verify the executable is named correctly), run the following command:
	mkdir -p tmp; cp Sully tmp/; cd tmp/; ./Sully ; ls -al | grep Sully | wc -l

	The number displayed on the standard output should be 13.
	Run the following command:
	diff ../Sully.c Sully_5.c ; diff ../Sully.c Sully_4.c ; diff Sully_5.c Sully_0.c

	The only difference must be the integer set initially, which is decremented at each step.

	Verify that the program does not use arguments for main(). If it does, select the
	CHEAT flag. The correction ends here.

	Verify that with an initial integer of -1, the program should not do anything.
	If there are any errors, the correction ends here.



===   Colleen ASM   ===

1 . Colleen_start
[ Yes / No ]

	Examine the source code. Make sure it follows the following restrictions:

		Two comments as specified in the subject, including comment within a function.
		A function in addition to main().
		A call to that function from main().

2 . Compilation & checking
[ Yes / No ]

	Run make.

	Once compiled (verify the executable is named correctly), run the following command:
	./Colleen > tmp_Colleen; diff tmp_Colleen Colleen.s

	If there were any errors (diff output), the correction ends here.



===   Grace ASM   ===

1 . Grace_start
[ Yes / No ]

	Examine the source code. Make sure it follows the following restrictions:

		A comment as specified in the subject.
		No direct functions, (main() included).
		Three defines.

2 . Compilation & checking
[ Yes / No ]

	Run make.

	Once compiled (verify the executable is named correctly), run the following command:
	rm Grace_kid.s; ./Grace ; diff Grace_kid.s Grace.s

	If there were any errors (diff output), the correction ends here.



===   Sully ASM   ===

1 . Sully_start
[ Yes / No ]

	Examine the source code. Make sure it follows the following restrictions:

		An integer initialized to 5.

2 . Compilation & checking
[ Yes / No ]

	Run make.

	Once compiled (verify the executable is named correctly), run the following command:
	mkdir -p tmp; cp Sully tmp/; cd tmp/; ./Sully ; ls -al | grep Sully | wc -l

	The number displayed on the standard output should be 13.
	Run the following command:
	diff ../Sully.s Sully_5.s ; diff ../Sully.s Sully_4.s ; diff Sully_5.s Sully_0.s

	The only difference must be the integer set initially, which is decremented at each step.

	Verify that the program does not use arguments for main(). If it does, select the
	CHEAT flag. The correction ends here.

	Verify that with an initial integer of -1, the program should not do anything.
	If there are any errors, the correction ends here.



===   Dr_Quine Bonus   ===
[ Yes / No ]

	Only grade the bonus section if ALL previous cases are PERFECT.

	You may only count the bonus if all three quines were recoded in another language
	and all pass the test cases specified above.
