===  Mandatory part  ===

1 . Deposit
[ Yes / No ]

In the deposit of the evaluated person we must have:

    A README.md file in the root. Inspect the contents quickly to see that it is not empty.
    A Makefile in the root. Inspect the contents quickly to see that it is not empty.
    The source code of the program.

With the help of the evaluator it should be possible to compile (if needed) and run the
generated program.
Use the --version option to check that it runs correctly.

If there is an error, you must stop the evaluation.

2 . Encryption of files
[ Yes / No ]

Now you need to add test files to the folder to be infected by this program.
The person being evaluated must help you.

Run the program and make a comparison with an uninfected file to see that stockholm works properly.
You have to check that these files are really modified and that they are not readable/usable anymore.

This is the time to discuss the algorithm chosen in order to encrypt these files.
You can also discuss how to generate the key used.

You can use anything you want to validate the quality of the program. You can add files already encrypted or other.

If there is an error, you must stop the evaluation.

3 . Decryption of files
[ Yes / No ]

You must now use the key generated on the previously encrypted files to reverse the process
and thus have the original files usable. The program must:

    Displays a list of files that are encrypted.
    It performs the decryption and in case of error it notifies the file that cannot be decrypted.
    All exceptions are handled.

You can use anything you want to validate the quality of the program by using another key to
decrypt or by adding unencrypted files with a specific extension.

If there is an error, you must stop the evaluation.
