===  Mandatory part  ===

1 . ft_otp
[ Yes / No ]

The program complies with the following sections:

    The algorithm uses HOTP (RFC4226) as the key building block.
    The algorithm generates keys randomly.
    There is at least 2 flags (-g -k).
    All exceptions are handled. If there is an error, you must stop the evaluation.

2 . Usage
[ Yes / No ]

According to the example on the subject you have to check that:

    Use an incorrect key size with the -g option. You should get an error.
    Use the correct key size with the -g option. You should have a new file generated you can check that this file is different from the basic one used.
    Use the new file generated with the -k flag. You must have a value that changes in time. This generate key is a usable password.

With the help of the person being evaluated you can compare the result with the reference tool
used to complete this project.
If there is a problem, you must stop the evaluation.
